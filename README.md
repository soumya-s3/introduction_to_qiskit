# Qiskit Developer Certification notebook
I have created this notebook while preparing for the Qiskit Developer Certification exam https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300. 
There is already some guidance available in the internet along with the qiskit textbook which is a must read to prepare for the exam. This notebook will help you to get a better idea about what kind of questions to expect in the exam.
I would like to thank Mr. Vishal Bajpe(https://github.com/mrvee-qC) for his constant support in my qiskit journey.
Also this repository https://github.com/bartubisgin/qiskit-certified-exam-workbook by Mr. Bartu Bisgin has been really helpful.
Good Luck qiskitters. Keep learning.
